# Creating New SOPs

Standard Operating Procedures should be clear, actionable, and easy to follow.

## Structure

Every SOP should include:

1. **Purpose** - Why does this procedure exist?
2. **Scope** - What does this cover?
3. **Prerequisites** - What's needed before starting?
4. **Steps** - Clear, numbered instructions
5. **Verification** - How to confirm success
6. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
