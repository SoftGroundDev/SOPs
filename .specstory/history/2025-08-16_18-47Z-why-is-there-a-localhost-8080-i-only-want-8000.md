Why is there a localhost:8080 I only want 8000

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you identify why there's a localhost:8080 when you only want 8000. Let me search through your workspace to find where port 8080 is being configured. I found the issue! The port 8080 is configured in your `package.json` file in the "preview" script. Let me also check for any other references to port 8000 to understand your setup better: Perfect! I can see the issue clearly now. Your main application is designed to run on port 8000 (as seen in `serve.py`, `serve_new.py`, and `sops.sh`), but there's one inconsistency in your `package.json` file where the preview script is using port 8080.

Let me fix this by updating the `package.json` file to use port 8000 instead of 8080: Now I'll fix the port mismatch by changing 8080 to 8000 in the preview script: 
```

```
I should also update the documentation to be consistent. Let me fix the `DEPLOYMENT.md` and `NETLIFY.md` files: 
```

```

I don't want the 8080 site. I think it was the 8000 site that we were working on. How come an entirely new site was built

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me investigate what's happening with the different sites and ports. It sounds like there might be multiple server implementations or build processes creating confusion. Now I understand! You have two different systems:

1. **Dynamic server (port 8000)**: The `serve.py` file that serves your Obsidian vault dynamically with live Markdown rendering
2. **Static site (port 8080)**: The `build_static.py` that generates static HTML files and serves them via a simple HTTP server

The port 8080 site is created when you run `npm run preview`, which:
1. Runs `build_static.py` to generate static HTML files in the `` folder 
2. Serves those static files on port 8080

Let me check what exactly the static build process does: I can see there's a `` folder that was created by the static build process. The issue is:

- **Port 8000**: Your main dynamic server (`serve.py`) that serves the Obsidian vault with live Markdown rendering
- **Port 8080**: A static version created by `build_static.py` for deployment purposes (like Netlify)

The static build (8080) creates a separate, standalone version of your site that doesn't require the Python server to run. This is typically used for deployment to static hosting services.

If you only want to use port 8000 with your dynamic server, you can:

1. **Remove the static build** by deleting the `` folder
2. **Stick to using the main server commands** like `npm start` or `python3 serve.py`

Let me show you the difference in what commands do what: Here's what's happening:

**For your main site (port 8000):**
- `npm start` or `npm run serve` → Runs `serve.py` on port 8000
- This serves your Obsidian vault dynamically with live Markdown rendering

**For the static site (port 8000 now, was 8080):**
- `npm run preview` → Builds static files and serves them
- This creates a `` folder with pre-built HTML files

Would you like me to remove the `` folder and the static build functionality entirely, so you only have the port 8000 dynamic server?
