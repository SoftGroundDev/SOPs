Set up the project to be served off netlify

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you set up the project to be served on Netlify. First, let me examine the current project structure and understand what we're working with. Now I understand the project structure. This is a Python-based web server that serves an Obsidian vault as a knowledge base. To deploy this on Netlify, I need to convert it to a static site since Netlify primarily serves static sites (though it supports serverless functions). 

Let me create the necessary files to make this work on Netlify:

1. First, I'll create a build script that generates static HTML files
2. Create a Netlify configuration file
3. Add a static site generator
